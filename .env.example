# Cloudinary Configuration
# Get these values from your Cloudinary dashboard: https://console.cloudinary.com/

# Your Cloudinary cloud name (REQUIRED for image loading)
# This is public and safe to expose in the browser
# Find it in your Cloudinary Dashboard under "Product Environment Credentials"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dhegnhnyn

# Cloudinary API credentials (REQUIRED for upload scripts)
# These are secret and should NEVER be exposed in the browser
# Only needed for server-side operations (uploading, deleting, etc.)
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here

# IMPORTANT: For production deployment
# =====================================
# 1. Set these environment variables in your deployment platform:
#    - Vercel: Project Settings > Environment Variables
#    - Netlify: Site Settings > Environment Variables
#    - Other platforms: Check their documentation for environment variable configuration
#
# 2. Make sure NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME is set for all environments (Development, Preview, Production)
#
# 3. API_KEY and API_SECRET are only needed if you're running upload scripts in production (not recommended)
#    - For local development: Copy this file to .env.local and add your real credentials
#    - For production: Only set NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME unless you need server-side uploads
